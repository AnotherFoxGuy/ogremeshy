Compiling under Windows:
========================

You'll need:
 * At least MSVC 2008 (Express Editions work)
 * Ogre SDK
 * wxWidgets SDK with AUI support

You'll have to setup the paths to the SDKs in the Project Config propierties
(Alt+F7 -> Configuration Propierties -> C/C++ -> Addintional Include Directories)

Currently it assumes the following paths:
 E:\Projects\SDK\wxWidgets-2.8.7
 E:\Projects\SDK\Ogre

You'll have to do the same in the linker section of the config propierties.
If you're having trouble with this, Google is your friend.

Alternatively you can use CMake, it will work. However you'll need the OGRE_HOME path environment to be set (i.e. have Ogre SDK installed) so that CMake can detect the installation directory.

To create the installer, go to scripts\NSIS and compile OgreMeshy.nsi


Compiling under Linux:
======================
You'll need CMake www.cmake.org   You can get an explanation of how CMake works here http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/Getting+started+with+CMake
You'll need wxWidgets 2.8 or higher
You'll need dev OGRE installed in your system
You'll need OpenGL dev libraries (they usually come with Mesa or X11)

Copy all necessary Resources files to folder bin/Release_Linux/Resources; the following script will do that for you:
	cd scripts/Resources
	sh copyresources.sh
Create your binary output folder with CMake at %OgreMeshyFolder%/build
Go to that folder and type from command line:
	cd build
	make all
Copy the created binary "OgreMeshy" to bin/Release_Linux
	cp OgreMeshy ../bin/Release_Linux/OgreMeshy
Copy the following plugins to bin/Release_Linux/Plugins:
	Plugin_CgProgramManager.so
	Plugin_ParticleFX.so
	Plugin_OctreeSceneManager.so
	RenderSystem_GL.so
	Note they're usually located either in /usr/local/lib/OGRE or /usr/lib/OGRE
Now run "make install" from folder /bin/Release_Linux
Type ogremeshy in any terminal and enjoy running the program!
To remove it, type "make uninstall" from folder /bin/Release_Linux
That's it!

Note the Linux port isn't a thoroughly tested as the Windows version, so it may be buggy. Hence, linux support is in beta stage

Long story short:
-----------------
cd scripts/Resources
sh copyresources.sh
# CMake here to %OgreMeshyFolder%/build
cd ../../build
make all
cp OgreMeshy ../bin/Release_Linux/OgreMeshy
# Copy plugins plugins either from /usr/local/lib/OGRE or /usr/lib/OGRE to bin/Release_Linux/Plugins:
cd ../bin/Release_Linux
make install


Compiling under Mac OS X:
=========================
I do not own a Mac, so I don't know about it.
However you may run into trouble because Ogre Meshy works with relative paths, and I've heard Mac OS doesn't like relative paths.
See xWidgetsApp::setWorkingDirectory()
Porting efforts would be bigger since you'll need to put the folder prefix at all strings containing folders.
I'm interesting in hearing your porting results, post them at: http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=59600


Files generated by wxFormBuilder:
=================================
Under scripts/wxFormBuilder you'll find the project file. The generated files go to src/Core and include/Core folders
However you'll need to modify wxOgreMeshViewerMainFrame.cpp so that it says:

#include "Core/wxOgreMeshViewerMainFrame.h"

instead of:

#include "wxOgreMeshViewerMainFrame.h"

Note:
For some reason, wxFormBuilder generates 3 weird characters at the beginning of it's generated files. If you're using GCC and get:
error: stray ‘\357’ in program
error: stray ‘\273’ in program
error: stray ‘\277’ in program

Then open the conflicting file, delete the first line and write it again.
Usually just hitting backspace then Supr then write the deleted character again works (it's faster than retyping the whole line).

Resources
=========
Under folder scripts\Resources you'll find everything I used, mesh files, icons, etc.
Even the original blender files I used to create those icons.
If the poorly written copyresources.bat script doesn't copy all necessary resources to the bin/Debug or Release folders, do it manually :-)
