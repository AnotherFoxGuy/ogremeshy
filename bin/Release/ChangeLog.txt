Reloading a resources.cfg file would stop the reloading at the first particle script encountered, since particle templates weren't being destroyed.
Reloading a resources.cfg now updates automatically the material in used in case such material and/or it's shaders were defined among those resources
Reloading resources.cfg with corrupted material data being in use could ocassionally cause crashes (and always in Linux)
Improved Linux stability
