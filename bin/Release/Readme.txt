TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
If the program doesn't start, you may need the following:

Visual C++ 2008 SP1 redist   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a5c84275-3b97-4ab7-a40d-3802b2af5fc2&displaylang=en
Latest DirectX               http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0CEF8180-E94A-4F56-B157-5AB8109CB4F5&displaylang=en

If you click the track node in the tree window when an animation is active, the axis will appear at that specific bone. To hide it, click in the name of the animation at the top (root) of the tree or select "None" as animation.

**IMPORTANT: Linux Users**
OgreMeshy needs to have RW access to the folder "/home/username/.ogremeshy"

FAQ
===

Q: The whole window is blank, I can only see the toolbar and menu.
A: Possibly the GUI_Layout.cfg file is corrupted. Delete it and restart the application

Q: The displayed bones are too big/small!
A: Go to animation Tab, there is a slider that says "Bone size".

Q: The bone name's text (Alt+D) is too big/small!
A: Go to animation Tab, there is a slider that says "Bone size". It scales both the bones and bone name text when they're displayed. Additionally, you can edit the text file "Default.fontdef" in an external editor, which is located under the folder "Resources/Fonts", and change the default font size.

Linux specific:
---------------
Q: I get to the Render API OpenGL selection screen, hit ok, and then the program exits.
A: Check the folder "~/.ogremeshy" exists, which is where Ogre Meshy saves all config data. (i.e. /home/myusername/.ogremeshy)

Q: The program exits right after saying 'Loading Plugin CgProgramManager' in the console, it doesn't even show up a window
A: Make sure Cg libs are installed. If it still fails or you don't want to install them, edit plugins.cfg with a text editor and remove that plugin.

Q: It doesn't work
A: Linux support is still in beta. Share your experience at http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=59600


KNOWN ISSUES:
=============
* On Direct3D, the render window may flicker against the other dockable windows. To fix this, resize the main window or minimize & restore
* On OpenGL, the render window may not be updated after resizing one of the docked windows. To fix this, resize the main window or minimize & restore
* When loading resources.cfg, it attempts to load _all_ resources it founds, some of them may crash the viewer even if they're not materials
* Free mode camera is not yet supported, despite being displayed in the menu
