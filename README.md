This is a mirror of the source code for OgreMeshy, a mesh viewer for [OGRE](http://ogre3d.org)
Works on Windows and Linux.

## Requirements
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* Windows only: At least MSVC 2017
* Linux only: GCC >5 or Clang.

## Compiling ##

Build the CMake folder into the folder "build". Then compile it (make in Linux, open the generated sln file in Visual Studio, etc)
If the build completed without any errors, you have to build the copy_resources target in order to copy the resources required for running ogremeshy.

**IMPORTANT: Linux Users**
OgreMeshy needs to have RW access to the folder "/home/username/.ogremeshy"


### Files generated by wxFormBuilder ###
Under scripts/wxFormBuilder you'll find the project file. The generated files go to src/Core and include/Core folders
However you'll need to modify wxOgreMeshViewerMainFrame.cpp so that it says:


```
#!c++

#include "Core/wxOgreMeshViewerMainFrame.h"
```


instead of:


```
#!c++

#include "wxOgreMeshViewerMainFrame.h"
```


**Note:**
For some reason, older versions of wxFormBuilder produces the unicode BOM header at the beginning of it's generated files. If you're using GCC and get:

error: stray ‘\357’ in program

error: stray ‘\273’ in program

error: stray ‘\277’ in program

Then open the conflicting file, delete the first line and write it again.
Usually just hitting backspace then Supr then write the deleted character again works (it's faster than retyping the whole line).


### Resources ###
Under folder scripts\Resources you'll find everything I used, mesh files, icons, etc.
Even the original blender files I used to create those icons.
